## Geo Functions

### ST_DISTANCE / DISTANCE

Computes the geodesic distance (great-circle distance) between two points.

**Syntax:**
```sql
ST_DISTANCE(point1, point2)
DISTANCE(point1, point2)  -- Alias
```

**Inputs:**

Each point can be:
- A column of type `geo_point` in Elasticsearch
- A literal defined with `POINT(latitude, longitude)`

**Output:**
- Distance value (numeric) that can be compared with distance literals

**Distance Literals:**

When comparing distances, specify the unit directly after the numeric value:

```sql
value km    -- Kilometers
value m     -- Meters (default if no unit)
value cm    -- Centimeters
value mm    -- Millimeters
value mi    -- Miles
value yd    -- Yards
value ft    -- Feet
value in    -- Inches
value nmi   -- Nautical miles
```

**Performance Note:**

If both arguments are fixed points, the distance is **precomputed at query compilation time**.

### Supported Distance Units

| Category | Unit | Syntax | Example |
|----------|------|--------|---------|
| **Metric** | Kilometers | `km` | `5000 km`, `10.5 km` |
| | Meters | `m` | `500 m`, `1000 m` |
| | Centimeters | `cm` | `100 cm`, `50 cm` |
| | Millimeters | `mm` | `1000 mm`, `500 mm` |
| **Imperial** | Miles | `mi` | `10 mi`, `5.5 mi` |
| | Yards | `yd` | `100 yd`, `50 yd` |
| | Feet | `ft` | `500 ft`, `100 ft` |
| | Inches | `in` | `100 in`, `50 in` |
| **Nautical** | Nautical Miles | `nmi` | `50 nmi`, `10 nmi` |

### POINT

Creates a geo-point from latitude and longitude.

**Syntax:**
```sql
POINT(latitude, longitude)
```

**Inputs:**
- `latitude` - DOUBLE (-90 to 90)
  - Positive values: North
  - Negative values: South
- `longitude` - DOUBLE (-180 to 180)
  - Positive values: East
  - Negative values: West

**Output:**
- `geo_point` type

**Examples:**

**1. Create a point:**
```sql
SELECT POINT(48.8566, 2.3522) as paris_location
-- Paris: 48.8566°N, 2.3522°E
```

**2. Major world cities:**
```sql
-- Paris, France
SELECT POINT(48.8566, 2.3522) as paris

-- London, UK
SELECT POINT(51.5074, -0.1278) as london

-- New York, USA
SELECT POINT(40.7128, -74.0060) as new_york

-- Tokyo, Japan
SELECT POINT(35.6762, 139.6503) as tokyo

-- Sydney, Australia
SELECT POINT(-33.8688, 151.2093) as sydney
```

**3. Use in distance calculation:**
```sql
-- Distance between Paris and London
SELECT 
  ST_DISTANCE(POINT(48.8566, 2.3522), POINT(51.5074, -0.1278)) AS distance
WHERE ST_DISTANCE(POINT(48.8566, 2.3522), POINT(51.5074, -0.1278)) < 400 km
-- Result: precomputed distance, approximately 343 km
```

**4. Use in WHERE clause:**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM stores
WHERE ST_DISTANCE(POINT(48.8566, 2.3522), location) < 5 km
```

### Unit Selection Guidelines

**Choose the appropriate unit based on your use case:**

| Use Case | Recommended Unit | Example Query |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| City/Urban search | `km` or `m` | `WHERE ST_DISTANCE(...) < 5 km` |
| Country/Regional | `km` or `mi` | `WHERE ST_DISTANCE(...) < 100 km` |
| Maritime/Aviation | `nmi` | `WHERE ST_DISTANCE(...) < 50 nmi` |
| Building/Indoor | `m` or `ft` | `WHERE ST_DISTANCE(...) < 100 m` |
| Precision tracking | `m` or `cm` | `WHERE ST_DISTANCE(...) < 50 m` |
| US-based apps | `mi` or `ft` | `WHERE ST_DISTANCE(...) < 10 mi` |
| International apps | `km` or `m` | `WHERE ST_DISTANCE(...) < 10 km` |
