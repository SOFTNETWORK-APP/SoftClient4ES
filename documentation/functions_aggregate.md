## Overview

Aggregate functions perform calculations on sets of rows and return a single result. They are commonly used with `GROUP BY` clauses to summarize data by categories.

**Key Concepts:**
- **Aggregate Functions**: Operate on multiple rows to produce a single result
- **GROUP BY**: Groups rows that have the same values in specified columns
- **HAVING**: Filters groups based on aggregate conditions
- **Window Functions**: Perform calculations across rows related to the current row

## Function: COUNT

**Description:**  
Count rows or non-null expressions. With `DISTINCT` counts distinct values.

**Syntax:**
```sql
COUNT(*)
COUNT(expr)
COUNT(DISTINCT expr)
```

**Inputs:**
- `*` - Count all rows (including NULLs)
- `expr` - Count non-NULL values in expression
- `DISTINCT expr` - Count distinct non-NULL values

**Output:**
- `BIGINT` - Number of rows/values

**NULL Handling:**
- `COUNT(*)` includes rows with NULL values
- `COUNT(expr)` excludes NULL values
- `COUNT(DISTINCT expr)` excludes NULL values

**Examples:**

**Basic COUNT:**
```sql
-- Count all rows
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total FROM emp;
-- Result: total = 42

-- Count non-NULL values
SELECT COUNT(manager) AS employees_with_manager FROM emp;

-- Count with WHERE
SELECT COUNT(*) AS it_employees 
FROM emp 
WHERE department = 'IT';
```

**COUNT DISTINCT:**
```sql
-- Count distinct salaries
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT salary) AS distinct_salaries FROM emp;
-- Result: 8

-- Count distinct departments
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT department) AS dept_count FROM emp;

-- Count distinct non-NULL emails
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT email) AS unique_emails FROM users;
```

**COUNT with GROUP BY:**
```sql
-- Count employees per department
SELECT 
  department,
  COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM emp
GROUP BY department;

-- Count orders per customer
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- Count with multiple columns
SELECT 
  department,
  job_title,
  COUNT(*) AS count
FROM emp
GROUP BY department, job_title;
```

**COUNT with HAVING:**
```sql
-- Departments with more than 10 employees
SELECT 
  department,
  COUNT(*) AS count
FROM emp
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 10;

-- Customers with multiple orders
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  COUNT(*) AS order_count
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

**COUNT vs COUNT(*):**
```sql
-- COUNT(*) counts all rows
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM emp;
-- Result: 42 (includes rows with NULL values)

-- COUNT(column) counts non-NULL values
SELECT COUNT(email) AS rows_with_email FROM emp;
-- Result: 38 (excludes 4 NULL emails)

-- Difference shows NULL count
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS total,
  COUNT(email) AS with_email,
  COUNT(*) - COUNT(email) AS without_email
FROM emp;
```

**Practical Examples:**

**1. Data quality check:**
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS total_records,
  COUNT(email) AS records_with_email,
  COUNT(phone) AS records_with_phone,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN email IS NOT NULL AND phone IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) AS complete_records
FROM contacts;
```

**2. Completion rate:**
```sql
SELECT 
  department,
  COUNT(*) AS total,
  COUNT(performance_review) AS reviewed,
  ROUND(COUNT(performance_review) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS review_completion_rate
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

**3. Active users:**
```sql
SELECT 
  DATE_TRUNC('month', login_date) AS month,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users
FROM user_logins
WHERE login_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 6 MONTH)
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', login_date)
ORDER BY month;
```

---

## Function: FIRST_VALUE

**Description:**  
Window function: returns the first value in an ordered partition. Pushed as `top_hits size=1` to Elasticsearch when possible.

**Syntax:**
```sql
FIRST_VALUE(expr) OVER (
  [PARTITION BY partition_expr, ...]
  [ORDER BY order_expr [ASC|DESC], ...]
)
```

**Inputs:**
- `expr` - Expression to return
- `PARTITION BY` - Optional grouping columns
- `ORDER BY` - Ordering specification (if not provided, only expr column name is used for sorting)

**Output:**
- Same type as input expression

**Behavior:**
- Returns the first value based on `ORDER BY` within each partition
- If `OVER` is not provided, only the expr column name is used for sorting
- Optimized to Elasticsearch `top_hits` aggregation with `size=1`

**Examples:**

**Basic FIRST_VALUE:**
```sql
-- First salary in each department (ordered by hire date)
SELECT 
  department,
  name,
  salary,
  FIRST_VALUE(salary) OVER (
    PARTITION BY department 
    ORDER BY hire_date ASC
  ) AS first_salary
FROM emp;
```

**Without PARTITION BY:**
```sql
-- First hire across entire company
SELECT 
  name,
  hire_date,
  FIRST_VALUE(name) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date ASC) AS first_hired_employee
FROM emp;
```

**Without OVER clause:**
```sql
-- Uses expr column name for sorting
SELECT 
  department,
  FIRST_VALUE(salary) AS first_salary_value
FROM emp;
```

**Multiple Partitions:**
```sql
-- First employee hired in each department and job title
SELECT 
  department,
  job_title,
  name,
  hire_date,
  FIRST_VALUE(name) OVER (
    PARTITION BY department, job_title
    ORDER BY hire_date ASC
  ) AS first_in_role
FROM emp;
```

**Practical Examples:**

**1. First purchase per customer:**
```sql
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  order_id,
  order_date,
  total_amount,
  FIRST_VALUE(total_amount) OVER (
    PARTITION BY customer_id
    ORDER BY order_date ASC
  ) AS first_order_amount
FROM orders;
```

**2. Initial stock price:**
```sql
SELECT 
  stock_symbol,
  trade_date,
  closing_price,
  FIRST_VALUE(closing_price) OVER (
    PARTITION BY stock_symbol
    ORDER BY trade_date ASC
  ) AS initial_price
FROM stock_prices;
```

**3. Baseline metrics:**
```sql
SELECT 
  server_name,
  timestamp,
  cpu_usage,
  FIRST_VALUE(cpu_usage) OVER (
    PARTITION BY server_name
    ORDER BY timestamp ASC
  ) AS baseline_cpu
FROM server_metrics
WHERE DATE(timestamp) = CURRENT_DATE;
```

**Comparison with MIN:**
```sql
-- FIRST_VALUE (order-dependent)
SELECT 
  department,
  FIRST_VALUE(salary) OVER (
    PARTITION BY department 
    ORDER BY hire_date ASC
  ) AS first_hired_salary
FROM emp;

-- MIN (value-dependent)
SELECT 
  department,
  MIN(salary) AS lowest_salary
FROM emp
GROUP BY department;
```

---

## Function: LAST_VALUE

**Description:**  
Window function: returns the last value in an ordered partition. Pushed to Elasticsearch by flipping sort order in `top_hits`.

**Syntax:**
```sql
LAST_VALUE(expr) OVER (
  [PARTITION BY partition_expr, ...]
  [ORDER BY order_expr [ASC|DESC], ...]
)
```

**Inputs:**
- `expr` - Expression to return
- `PARTITION BY` - Optional grouping columns
- `ORDER BY` - Ordering specification (if not provided, only expr column name is used for sorting)

**Output:**
- Same type as input expression

**Behavior:**
- Returns the last value based on `ORDER BY` within each partition
- If `OVER` is not provided, only the expr column name is used for sorting
- Optimized to Elasticsearch `top_hits` by reversing sort order

**Examples:**

**Basic LAST_VALUE:**
```sql
-- Last salary in each department (ordered by hire date)
SELECT 
  department,
  name,
  salary,
  LAST_VALUE(salary) OVER (
    PARTITION BY department 
    ORDER BY hire_date ASC
  ) AS last_salary
FROM emp;
```

**Without PARTITION BY:**
```sql
-- Most recent hire across entire company
SELECT 
  name,
  hire_date,
  LAST_VALUE(name) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date ASC) AS last_hired_employee
FROM emp;
```

**Without OVER clause:**
```sql
-- Uses expr column name for sorting
SELECT 
  department,
  LAST_VALUE(salary) AS last_salary_value
FROM emp;
```

**Multiple Partitions:**
```sql
-- Last employee hired in each department and job title
SELECT 
  department,
  job_title,
  name,
  hire_date,
  LAST_VALUE(name) OVER (
    PARTITION BY department, job_title
    ORDER BY hire_date ASC
  ) AS last_in_role
FROM emp;
```

**Practical Examples:**

**1. Most recent purchase per customer:**
```sql
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  order_id,
  order_date,
  total_amount,
  LAST_VALUE(total_amount) OVER (
    PARTITION BY customer_id
    ORDER BY order_date ASC
  ) AS last_order_amount
FROM orders;
```

**2. Latest stock price:**
```sql
SELECT 
  stock_symbol,
  trade_date,
  closing_price,
  LAST_VALUE(closing_price) OVER (
    PARTITION BY stock_symbol
    ORDER BY trade_date ASC
  ) AS current_price
FROM stock_prices;
```

**3. Current status:**
```sql
SELECT 
  user_id,
  status_change_date,
  status,
  LAST_VALUE(status) OVER (
    PARTITION BY user_id
    ORDER BY status_change_date ASC
  ) AS current_status
FROM user_status_history;
```

**Comparison with MAX:**
```sql
-- LAST_VALUE (order-dependent)
SELECT 
  department,
  LAST_VALUE(salary) OVER (
    PARTITION BY department 
    ORDER BY hire_date ASC
  ) AS last_hired_salary
FROM emp;

-- MAX (value-dependent)
SELECT 
  department,
  MAX(salary) AS highest_salary
FROM emp
GROUP BY department;
```

**FIRST_VALUE vs LAST_VALUE:**
```sql
-- Compare first and last values
SELECT 
  department,
  FIRST_VALUE(salary) OVER (
    PARTITION BY department 
    ORDER BY hire_date ASC
  ) AS first_hire_salary,
  LAST_VALUE(salary) OVER (
    PARTITION BY department 
    ORDER BY hire_date ASC
  ) AS last_hire_salary,
  LAST_VALUE(salary) OVER (
    PARTITION BY department 
    ORDER BY hire_date ASC
  ) - FIRST_VALUE(salary) OVER (
    PARTITION BY department 
    ORDER BY hire_date ASC
  ) AS salary_change
FROM emp;
```

## Function: ARRAY_AGG

**Description:**  
Collect values into an array for each partition. Implemented using `OVER` and pushed to Elasticsearch as `top_hits`. Post-processing converts hits to an array of scalars.

**Syntax:**
```sql
ARRAY_AGG(expr) OVER (
  [PARTITION BY partition_expr, ...]
  [ORDER BY order_expr [ASC|DESC], ...]
)
```

**Inputs:**
- `expr` - Expression to collect
- `PARTITION BY` - Optional grouping columns
- `ORDER BY` - Optional ordering (if not provided, only expr column name is used for sorting)

**Output:**
- `ARRAY<type_of_expr>` - Array of collected values

**Behavior:**
- Collects all values of `expr` within each partition into an array
- If `OVER` is not provided, only the expr column name is used for sorting
- Optimized to Elasticsearch `top_hits` aggregation
- Post-processing converts hits to array of scalars

**Examples:**

**Basic ARRAY_AGG:**
```sql
-- Collect employee names per department
SELECT 
  department,
  ARRAY_AGG(name) OVER (
    PARTITION BY department 
    ORDER BY hire_date ASC
  ) AS employees
FROM emp
LIMIT 100;
-- Result: employees as an array of name values per department (sorted and limited)
```

**Without PARTITION BY:**
```sql
-- Collect all employee names (ordered)
SELECT 
  ARRAY_AGG(name) OVER (ORDER BY hire_date ASC) AS all_employees
FROM emp;
```

**Without OVER clause:**
```sql
-- Uses expr column name for sorting
SELECT 
  department,
  ARRAY_AGG(name) AS employee_list
FROM emp;
```

**With Multiple Columns:**
```sql
-- Collect salaries per department
SELECT 
  department,
  ARRAY_AGG(salary) OVER (
    PARTITION BY department 
    ORDER BY salary DESC
  ) AS salary_list
FROM emp;
```

**Ordered Collection:**
```sql
-- Collect products by price (high to low)
SELECT 
  category,
  ARRAY_AGG(product_name) OVER (
    PARTITION BY category 
    ORDER BY price DESC
  ) AS products_by_price
FROM products
LIMIT 100;
```

**Practical Examples:**

**1. Customer order history:**
```sql
SELECT 
  customer_id,
  ARRAY_AGG(order_id) OVER (
    PARTITION BY customer_id 
    ORDER BY order_date DESC
  ) AS order_history,
  ARRAY_AGG(total_amount) OVER (
    PARTITION BY customer_id 
    ORDER BY order_date DESC
  ) AS amount_history
FROM orders
LIMIT 1000;
```

**2. Product tags:**
```sql
SELECT 
  product_id,
  product_name,
  ARRAY_AGG(tag) OVER (
    PARTITION BY product_id 
    ORDER BY tag ASC
  ) AS tags
FROM product_tags
LIMIT 500;
```

**3. Timeline of events:**
```sql
SELECT 
  user_id,
  ARRAY_AGG(event_type) OVER (
    PARTITION BY user_id 
    ORDER BY event_timestamp ASC
  ) AS event_timeline,
  ARRAY_AGG(event_timestamp) OVER (
    PARTITION BY user_id 
    ORDER BY event_timestamp ASC
  ) AS timestamp_timeline
FROM user_events
WHERE event_timestamp >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 30 DAY)
LIMIT 1000;
```

**4. Hierarchical data:**
```sql
SELECT 
  manager_id,
  ARRAY_AGG(employee_name) OVER (
    PARTITION BY manager_id 
    ORDER BY hire_date ASC
  ) AS direct_reports
FROM employees
WHERE manager_id IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 100;
```

**LIMIT Consideration:**
```sql
-- Always use LIMIT with ARRAY_AGG to prevent memory issues
SELECT 
  department,
  ARRAY_AGG(name) OVER (
    PARTITION BY department 
    ORDER BY hire_date ASC
  ) AS employees
FROM emp
LIMIT 100;  -- Important: limits result set size
```

**Comparison with STRING_AGG (if available):**
```sql
-- ARRAY_AGG returns array
SELECT 
  department,
  ARRAY_AGG(name) OVER (PARTITION BY department) AS name_array
FROM emp;
-- Result: ['John', 'Jane', 'Bob']

-- STRING_AGG returns string (if supported)
SELECT 
  department,
  STRING_AGG(name, ', ') AS name_string
FROM emp
GROUP BY department;
-- Result: 'John, Jane, Bob'
```
